# Princicples of Data Analytics

This is a jupyter notebook of tasks completed for an assignment for the Principles of Data Analytics module as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics.

This analysis of the iris dataset by R.A. Fisher serves to demonstrate learning points over the course of the module.

Each task is stated in the relevant section and explored in the following code blocks.

## Setup

If you choose to run this in your own local environment, there is a requirements file that contains the necessary packages needed to execute all cells in the notebook. This can be imported as an environment using conda:

> $ conda create --name <env> --file <this file>

Alternatively you can browse the notebook directly in GitHub or use GitHub codespaces to run the code contained in the notebook:

1. Sign up for a free GitHub account.
2. Go to the repository page in your browser.
3. Click the green Code button.
4. Click the Codespaces tab.
5. Click Create New Codespace on main.
6. Click tasks.ipynb in the left browser. You may need to click off and back on if the page is loaded as code instead of as a notebook.
7. Click the play button next to the first code box and install the suggested extensions.
8. Select the installed python environment as the python interpreter.
